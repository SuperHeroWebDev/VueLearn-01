# VueLearn-01

> Hi! This is a project I made for learning vuejs. I had zero previous web development or coding experience, so this was very challenging but also rewarding.

Special thanks goes out to [the net ninja](https://www.thenetninja.co.uk/) and many many other amazing people that share their knowledge freely over the interwebs.
